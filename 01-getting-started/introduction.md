# Introduction to Git and GitHub

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in source code during software development.

## Key Concepts

- **Repository**: A storage location for your project
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your changes
- **Branch**: An independent line of development
- **Remote**: A repository hosted on a server (like GitHub)

## Why GitHub?

GitHub provides:
- Cloud storage for Git repositories
- Collaboration tools
- Issue tracking
- Project management features
- Code review capabilities

## Basic Workflow

1. Create/clone repository
2. Make changes
3. Stage changes (`git add`)
4. Commit changes (`git commit`)
5. Push to remote (`git push`)
